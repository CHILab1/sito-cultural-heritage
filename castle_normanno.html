                The Norman Castle of Aci Castello was the fulcrum of
                the development of the Aci territory in the medieval
                period. The oldest part probably dates before the Arab
                rule, built on a pre-existing roman fortification, but the
                first historical evidence dates to the 11th century AD.
                Historical vicissitudes have also influenced the
                architectural ones of the monument, which is configured
                as a rich palimpsest of chronological stratifications.
                After a slow decline in military, administrative and
                economic functions, in the 16th century AD the fortress
                was adapted first to barracks and then to a prison.
                The Castle currently houses a Civic Museum, consisting of
                three sections: mineralogy, paleontology and archaeology.

                The main goal is to define new strategies for the transmission of archaeological and cultural knowledge, promoting
                interactive and engaging experiences for users. In this sense, the project aims to develop an interactive virtual tour,
                enriched with informational points that utilize diverse media—such as 2D images, 3D models, descriptions of
                elements and places, and digital reconstructions—to provide a deeper understanding of the site. Another objective
                is the analysis of using augmented reality headsets to experience the virtual tour immersively.
                The project also includes the creation of a serious game, which integrates historical and scientific content to bring
                the public closer to academic research. Finally, the plan involves creating 3D models using advanced techniques such
                as photogrammetry and laser scanning. All these activities are supported by the study and analysis of the
                archaeological and historical potential of the monument to create a solid and engaging storytelling.

                captivating virtual visit, providing the public with a simple yet highly
                effective tool for cultural communication. Additionally, the tour will enable

                Serious games are not primarily designed for entertainment but are

                The study and analysis of the archaeological and historical potential of the Norman
                Castle, in order to highlight the peculiar aspects that characterize it, are at the heart of
                the fruition actions to be undertaken. Knowledge of the context leads to an in-depth
                understanding of the historical and cultural significance of the monument and allows us
                to reveal meanings and stories that make each asset unique. The effective
                communication of these aspects is not simply conveying specific notions, but must
                create storytelling, providing the public with an authentic and informed experience of
                discovery.

                during survey activities, a rich variety of digital objects, both 2D and 3D, can
